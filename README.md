# E-Valuating Seattle Charging: Watt’s best? 

## Project Group Members:
1. Jason Cao
2. Aiden Tan
3. Roxanne Dimadi
4. Katelyn Vu

## Project Type
### Data Presentation

## Questions of interest
1. Which areas in Seattle could use EV charging stations?
2. How can we evaluate the effectiveness of the location of Seattle’s current EV charging stations?
3. Which locations in Seattle are in need of EV charging stations?
4. How do the locations of current charging stations compare with our recommended locations (based on our efficiency metric)?

## Project Goal & Output
We will produce an interactive dashboard that allows users to:
- Explore current and recommended EV charging station locations in Seattle
- Visualize demand based on traffic, crime, and demographic variables
- Input custom criteria to refine recommendations

Final deliverables include:
A data-driven dashboard with user inputs & filters
Maps, charts, and efficiency metric visualizations
Interpretation & recommendations for potential charging station placements
